    <h2>The Aromatic Journey of Biryani: From Royal Kitchens to Global Fame</h2>
    <p> <em>Biryani</em>, a fragrant rice dish infused with spices, meats, or vegetables, has a rich history steeped in tradition and royalty. Its origins trace back to Persia, introduced to the Indian subcontinent by Mughal rulers during the 16th century. The Mughals elevated biryani to a regal dish, perfecting its flavors in royal kitchens. Over time, regional adaptations emerged, each adding unique ingredients and cooking methods.

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Â½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt

            </li>
           <li>1 medium onion and 2 tomatoes chopped</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
           <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
           <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces

           </li>
            <li>4 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>4 pods green cardamom</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in cilantro.</li>
            <li>Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and cardamom.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.</li>
