    <h2>The Journey of Pizza: From Origins to Modern Delight</h2>
    <p> Pizza, one of the world's most beloved dishes, traces its origins to ancient civilizations. The earliest versions date back to flatbreads topped with simple ingredients enjoyed by the Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans. However, the modern pizza as we know it today originated in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century. Street vendors served flatbreads topped with tomatoes, cheese, and olive oil, a quick meal for the working class. The Margherita pizza, named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, became a symbol of Italian culinary art, featuring the vibrant colors of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to today, <strong>pizza</strong> is a global phenomenon with countless variations tailored to local tastes. From Chicago's deep-dish to New York's thin crust and quirky toppings like pineapple and pickles, pizza has evolved into a canvas for creativity. Fun fact: the world's largest pizza, baked in Rome, measured over 13,500 square feet! Whether it's a cozy homemade pie or a slice from a street vendor, pizza remains a symbol of comfort and shared moments around the world.</p>
