    <h2>The Story of Noodles: A Culinary Marvel Across Cultures</h2>
    <p><em>Noodles</em>, a versatile and beloved dish, boast a history as rich as their flavors. Originating in ancient China over 4,000 years ago, they were first crafted from millet before wheat and rice varieties gained popularity. Marco Polo’s travels are often credited with introducing noodles to Europe, inspiring the creation of Italian pasta. However, noodles evolved independently across Asia, becoming a staple in various cuisines. From Japan’s delicate soba and udon to Korea’s chewy jajangmyeon and Vietnam’s fragrant pho, each culture has its unique spin on this timeless dish.</p>
        <p>In modern times, <strong>noodles</strong> have transcended borders to become a global comfort food, celebrated for their adaptability. Instant noodles, invented in Japan in 1958, revolutionized convenience dining, becoming a favorite for quick meals worldwide. Fun fact: the world’s longest handmade noodle, stretching over 3,000 meters, was created in China! Whether stir-fried, served in hearty broths, or paired with exotic sauces, noodles continue to bring people together over slurpy, satisfying bowls of goodness.</p>

        <h2 class="steps-noodles">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list-steps-noodles">
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, combine chicken, celery and their tops, carrot, onion and its peel, and pepper. Pour broth over and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender and falls from the bone, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, make noodles. In a large bowl, combine eggs, water, oil, salt and enough of the flour to make a stiff dough.</li>
            <li>Strain chicken stock, reserving meat, celery and carrots. Pull meat from bones and return strained stock and meat, celery and carrots to pot. Bring to a boil. Make noodles by cutting dough from a broth-dipped spoon or using scissors or your fingers to make small, chickpea sized, noodles and dropping them in the boiling water. When the noodles rise to the surface they are done.</li>
